Recall: Priority Queue for Dijkstra
Dijkstra's algorithm (computing shortest paths)
Each step: find unexplored vertex with smallest currently known distance
Desired data structure: priority queue
push(v, 7): insert v with priority 7
popMin(): extract element with smallest priority
decPrio(v, 4): decrease priority of v to 4
Note
Priority is often also called key
Other common names for the operations: insert, extractMin, decreaseKey
Goal for today
Develop a data structure supporting these operations
Each operation should be fast (O(log n))
First: only push and popMin

Pointer-based structures
Many small pieces of memory (nodes)
A node stores:
Data we actually care about
Addresses of other nodes (pointers)
Access by navigating along pointers
Today: binary tree
Each node stores:
