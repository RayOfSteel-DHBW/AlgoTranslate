Data Structures
What are they?
Algorithm: sequence of steps. Each step ...
reads (a few) data items from memory
processes the read data
writes data back to memory
Access to memory via addresses
Data structure: an abstraction layer above memory
hides how data are stored in memory
provides an interface with convenient operations

Two Ways of Storing Data
Arrays
A sequence of contiguous memory cells
Access via address/index anywhere in Θ(1)
Very close to the hardware
Today: convenience functions
Pointer-Based Structures
Many small pieces of memory (nodes)
A node stores:
data that actually interests us
addresses of other nodes (pointers)
Access by navigating through pointers
More abstracted from the hardware
Next time: lists as a simple example
