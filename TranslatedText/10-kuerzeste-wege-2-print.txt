Shortest paths with negative edge lengths
Problem: Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
Given a directed graph G = (V, E), edge lengths len : E → Z and s ∈ V,
compute dist(s, t) for all t ∈ V.
Negative cycles
A path may go around a cycle multiple times
Arbitrarily small length possible (distances −∞?)

Option 1
Allow only simple paths that do not visit vertices multiple times
Hamilton path problem as a special case
(probably no polynomial-time algorithm, see TGI next semester)

Option 2
Detect negative cycles
Abort when a negative cycle is found
