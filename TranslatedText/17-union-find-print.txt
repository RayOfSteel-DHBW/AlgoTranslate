Motivation: Union–Find
Last lecture: Kruskal's algorithm
In each step choose the minimum edge among all edges that do not form a cycle with already chosen edges
u

v

skip
What do we want to achieve?
Quickly test whether {u, v} closes a cycle
Equivalent: u and v lie in the same component
Inserting an edge merges two components
v
u
select
Desired operations
union(u, v): merge the components of u and v
find(v): component* of v
Test whether u and v are in the same component: find(u) = find(v)

v

u

u

v

*Implementation: choose a unique representative for each component and return that
