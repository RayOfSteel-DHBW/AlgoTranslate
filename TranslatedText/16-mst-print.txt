Problem statement MST
Definition
Let G = (V, E) be a graph. A tree on the same vertex set T = (V, E_T) with E_T ⊆ E is called a spanning tree of G.
Problem: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
Given a graph G = (V, E) with edge weights w : E → Z. Find a spanning tree T = (V, E_T) such that the sum of the weights in E_T is minimal.
Simplifying assumption
Unique weights, i.e., w(e1) ≠ w(e2) when e1 ≠ e2
No real difference, but it simplifies some things
