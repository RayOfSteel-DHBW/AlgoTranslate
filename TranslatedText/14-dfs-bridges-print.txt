Bridges in Graphs
Definition
Let G = (V, E) be a graph. An edge e = {u, v} ∈ E is called a bridge if u and v lie in different connected components of G − e.

Goal today
find all bridges
get to know depth-first search (DFS) better along the way

Why do we care about bridges?
Interesting graph-theoretic structure → minimal cuts
splits the graph into several components → good for divide and conquer
