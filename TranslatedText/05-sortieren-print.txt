Note: Lower bounds on running time
The algorithm requires Ω(n²) steps – what does that mean?
Interpretation 1: on every input the running time is at least quadratic
Interpretation 2: there exist inputs for which the running time is at least quadratic
What applies in this lecture?
Unless explicitly stated, we always talk about the worst case
So: Interpretation 2
Why do we do it like that?
Interpretation 1 looks at the best case – rarely relevant
Interpretation 2 is useful in various situations:
"every algorithm needs time Ω(n²)" → there is no sub-quadratic algorithm
"a specific algorithm has time Ω(n²) and O(n³)" → in the worst case its running time is between quadratic and cubic
