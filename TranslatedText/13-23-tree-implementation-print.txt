Last time
Search tree for managing sorted sequences
Pointer-based structure → good for insert/delete
Tree structure → simulates binary search
(2,3)-tree
Almost binary: each internal node has 2 or 3 children
Balanced: every leaf has the same depth
Maintaining the structure when inserting and deleting
Insertion may create nodes with 4 children → split
Deletion may create nodes with only 1 child
→ merge or rebalance
Moves the problem step by step upward
O(log n) height → O(log n) running time
